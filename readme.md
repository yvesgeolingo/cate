## Overview

**Cate** caters to the value added processes of Cocooro Catering. It is a seamless interactive web application that will enhance the client’s experience in event planning, reserving, inquiring, evaluating service and creating a menu proposal. The system will provide a recommendation tool of packages or will allow the customer to customize the packages they desire. It will improve the existing website and add features tailored to the need of the company.
The system’s goal is to correct the miscommunication gap between the company and client and to help the customer capture and plan the important details of the event. Utilizing this system will enhance the overall efficiency of the company, improve productivity of the employees, and ultimately increase the satisfaction of the customer. The system is a web-based application that is easily accessible through a computer or mobile phone.

The proposed system aims to improve the four vital processes of the company, namely the Inbound, Marketing and Sales, After Services, and Human Resources. The implementation of this project will also contain six components – The Reservation Module, Accounts Module, Payment Module, Service Evaluation Module and Content Management Module. These functionalities will address the issues that are identified during the course of the study and features that will streamline the processes of the company.
The target users of the system include the manager, customers, and staff of the company. There will be a user handle control that will handle the different level of access needed by each user group. The manager will be the administrator of the user group and creator of staff accounts and thus will have full access to the system. The customer user will have access on the Reservation Module which allows them to customize their own packages and see the packages offered by the company. This will ultimately shorten the event planning process of the company and reduce the amount of time spent meeting with the event coordinator.

Alongside the other built in features, the integration of an online calendar for the system which will centralize all the inquiries. It will include the auto generation of contracts, quotation and reports such as monthly event summary and sales report that would be easily accessible by the client and the company.
The manager would additionally be able to distribute event schedules to staff which can be viewed even outside the offices of the company.
